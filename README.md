# Lending Club Case Study Analysis
> The project mainly deals with the analysis of the loan data using different EDA methodlogies and understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## General Information
-  Project Description : 
    * The project mainly deals with finding out the driver variable which can lead to identify the applicant with risky loan. To identify these variable, loan data sheet needed to be analyzed and based on the EDA inferences risky variable to be found out
- Project Background : 
    *Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    * Identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    * Loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011

- Possiblity of Loan charge off will be more
